#You work at the UN in urban planning and are interested in tracking population growth across major metropolitan regions. You are hoping that by looking at historical population numbers 
#that you can predict future growth and help your team make decisions about resourcing.
#Use what you’ve learned about the basics of Python to calculate the population growth of Istanbul and print out a short report.
